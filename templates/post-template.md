  "title": "Your Post Title Here",
  "publication_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "categories": ["Category1", "Category2"],

}
```

## Post Structure

### Title
Choose a clear, descriptive title that captures the main insight or question.

**Good examples:**
- "Multi-GPU Training Performance: When Hardware Topology Matters"
- "TensorFlow Memory Optimization: A Deep Dive into Retracing Costs"
- "Kubernetes for ML: Scaling Challenges and Solutions"

### Introduction (2-3 paragraphs)
- **Hook**: Start with a compelling question or surprising finding
- **Context**: Why is this topic important?
- **Preview**: What will readers learn?

Example:
```markdown
What happens when you throw dual RTX 4070 Ti SUPER GPUs at a machine learning training problem? The answer might surprise you. This comprehensive analysis reveals why more GPUs doesn't always mean better performance, and how hardware topology can make or break your training efficiency.

```

### Problem Statement
Clearly define what you're investigating and why it matters.

### Methodology
- **Setup**: Hardware, software, testing environment
- **Approach**: How you conducted the research
- **Measurements**: What metrics you collected
- **Controls**: How you ensured valid results

### Results
Present your findings with:
- **Data**: Tables, charts, performance numbers
- **Visualizations**: Graphs and diagrams
- **Statistical Analysis**: When applicable
- **Raw Data**: Links to datasets

### Analysis & Insights
- **What do the results mean?**
- **Why do you see these patterns?**
- **What are the implications?**
- **How do these findings challenge or confirm existing knowledge?**

### Practical Recommendations
- **Actionable advice** for practitioners
- **When to apply** these findings
- **What to avoid** based on your research
- **Cost-benefit considerations**

### Code Examples
Include relevant, working code snippets:

```python
# Example: Intelligent GPU strategy selection
def should_use_multi_gpu(model_params, batch_size):
    if model_params < 1_000_000:
        return False, "Model too small for multi-GPU benefits"
    elif model_params < 5_000_000:
        return batch_size >= 128, "Large batch required for efficiency"
    else:
        return batch_size >= 64, "Large model benefits from parallelization"
```

### Future Work
- **Limitations** of current research
- **Next steps** for investigation
- **Open questions** for the community
- **Collaboration opportunities**

### Conclusion
Summarize key takeaways and their broader implications.

### References & Resources
- **Code repositories** with implementations
- **Data sources** and datasets
- **Related research** and citations
- **Tool documentation** and guides

## Content Guidelines

### Technical Depth

- **Clear, concise** sentences
- **Logical flow** between sections
- **Professional tone** throughout

### Visual Elements
- **Charts and graphs** to illustrate key points
- **Code snippets** with proper formatting
- **Diagrams** for complex concepts
- **Screenshots** when helpful (but use sparingly)

### Data Presentation
- **Tables** for numerical comparisons
- **Error bars** and confidence intervals when appropriate
