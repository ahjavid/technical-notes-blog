The result is a coherent, readable README that covers installation, basic usage, error handling, security considerations, and a concise API reference. However, the synthesis does not incorporate any content from the executor\u2019s plan (which was largely procedural and not substantive), and it lacks deeper insights or advanced usage patterns that could have been derived from the combined inputs. The integration is solid but could be more seamless by explicitly referencing the executor\u2019s phase structure or by adding a section that reflects the multi\u2011agent workflow. Overall, the synthesis is good, but there is room for richer integration and added value.",
