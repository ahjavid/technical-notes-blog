No calculations or strategies (e.g., pruning, sharding, or approximate counting) are provided.\n3. **Limited Edge\u2011Case Discussion** \u2013 The CRITIC\u2019s role is to challenge assumptions and identify edge cases. The output does not reflect any such critique or mitigation strategies (e.g., burst handling, clock skew, network partitions).\n4. **Latency Assurance** \u2013 The claim of sub\u20111\u202fms latency is plausible with Redis, but no benchmarking or profiling details are offered to substantiate this.\n5. **Distributed Deployment Nuances** \u2013 The proposal mentions a load balancer and Redis cluster but does not address how state is synchronized across limiter instances, how to handle failover, or how to maintain consistency under high load.\n\nOverall, the agent demonstrates a solid high\u2011level design and justification but lacks the depth, debate structure, and edge\u2011case coverage required for full alignment with the task.\n\n",
