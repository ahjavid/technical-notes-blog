Without this comparison, the recommendation lacks justification.\n2. **Limited Reasoning** \u2013 The reasoning is surface\u2011level: it simply states that each database is good for a particular use case. It does not explain why the hybrid approach satisfies the 10\u202fTB, 100\u202fK writes/second, complex query, and 99.9\u202f% availability requirements.\n3. **Shallow Depth** \u2013 The proposal does not discuss trade\u2011offs such as data replication, consistency, cost, operational complexity, or how the two systems would interoperate (e.g., data flow, schema alignment, query federation).\n4. **No Points of Agreement** \u2013 The task explicitly asked to identify common ground between the analysts, which is omitted.\n5. **Coherence** \u2013 The content is internally consistent and free of contradictions, which is a strength.\n\nTo improve the semantic quality, the synthesizer should:\n- Summarize each analyst\u2019s key arguments.\n- Highlight overlapping concerns (e.g., need for high write throughput, complex analytics, high availability).\n- Provide a more detailed rationale for the hybrid solution, including how data will be partitioned, how consistency and failover will be handled, and any cost or operational implications.\n- Offer alternative single\u2011solution options if a hybrid is too complex.\n\nWith these enhancements, the output would better meet the evaluation criteria and provide a more compelling, well\u2011reasoned recommendation.",

Without this comparison, the recommendation lacks justification.\\n2. **Limited Reasoning** \u2013 The reasoning is surface\u2011level: it simply states that each database is good for a particular use case. It does not explain why the hybrid approach satisfies the 10\u202fTB, 100\u202fK writes/second, complex query, and 99.9\u202f% availability requirements.\\n3. **Shallow Depth** \u2013 The proposal does not discuss trade\u2011offs such as data replication, consistency, cost, operational complexity, or how the two systems would interoperate (e.g., data flow, schema alignment, query federation).\\n4. **No Points of Agreement** \u2013 The task explicitly asked to identify common ground between the analysts, which is omitted.\\n5. **Coherence** \u2013 The content is internally consistent and free of contradictions, which is a strength.\\n\\nTo improve the semantic quality, the synthesizer should:\\n- Summarize each analyst\u2019s key arguments.\\n- Highlight overlapping concerns (e.g., need for high write throughput, complex analytics, high availability).\\n- Provide a more detailed rationale for the hybrid solution, including how data will be partitioned, how consistency and failover will be handled, and any cost or operational implications.\\n- Offer alternative single\u2011solution options if a hybrid is too complex.\\n\\nWith these enhancements, the output would better meet the evaluation criteria and provide a more compelling, well\u2011reasoned recommendation.\"\n}\n```"

Weights were adjusted to reflect the relative importance of each dimension while keeping the total weight at 1.0. Score anchors are defined at three points (2, 5, 8) to provide clear, unambiguous performance levels."
